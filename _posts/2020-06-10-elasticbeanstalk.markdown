"Elastic Beanstalk also provides sample applications that use Amazon EFS for shared storage. The two projects are configuration files that you can use with a standard WordPress or Drupal installer to run a blog or other content management system in a load balanced environment. When a user uploads a photo or other media, it is stored on an Amazon EFS file system, avoiding the need to use a plugin to store uploaded files in Amazon S3."
