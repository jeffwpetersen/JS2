Can I map a IP address and a port with /etc/hosts?
https://superuser.com/questions/1192774/can-i-map-a-ip-address-and-a-port-with-etc-hosts
What David Postill says is correct, but if you are really hoping to get rid of the 8000 port for local testing you might want to investigate setting up a reverse proxy via Apache or Nginx. That is the most common and accepted way to map a port-based address like 127.0.0.1:8000 to testdev.com. â€“ JakeGould Mar 27 '17 at 13:29
