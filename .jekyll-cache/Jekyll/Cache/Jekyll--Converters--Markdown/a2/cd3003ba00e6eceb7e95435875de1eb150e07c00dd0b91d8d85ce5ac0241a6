I"ö<p>Full module on github: <a href="https://github.com/jeffwpetersen/drupal_8_xml_image_migration">Drupal 8 XML image migration</a></p>

<p>Import content into Drupal 8 with associated image files using a csv or xml file. Importing will require 2 configuration files. One for the images and one for the nodes.
Image files are references and need to be migrated and referenced using the id that uniquely identifies the imported item. This id is stored in the migrate system.</p>

<p>First configure the source of your images data, in this case Iâ€™m useing the XML parser.<br />
Define your id: Iâ€™m using the name of the image which I have labled with the machine name name_image.<br />
Next define field names and then source location and destination.</p>
