            <p class="gray-7">Our latest work: <a href="http://pendergastkc.org">The Pendergast Years | Kansas City in the Jazz Age & Great Depression.</a> Tom Pendergast was a Democrat and Kansas City political boss who's corruption was legendary.</p><p class="gray-7">
                The Penderast Years site features advanced SOLR search to expose the metadata to use as navigation. One of my favorite collections using metadata navigation is  <a href="http://pendergastkc.org/search-solr/field_tgm_subject/Musicians-5221">Jazz musicians of the era.</a></p>
            <p class="gray-7">Deep Zoom functionality is used to allow inspections of historical documents. A favorite image of mine is <a href="http://pendergastkc.org/collection/10554/k0054-v12p194-01/plaza-dog-mart">The Plaza Dog Mart.</a></p>
